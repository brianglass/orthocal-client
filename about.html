            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Orthocal.info is an Eastern Orthodox calendar service providing
            a RESTful api describing commemorations, fasting, scripture
            readings and other information for each day of the liturgical year.
            Presently only the OCA is fully supported.  There is tentative
            support for ROCOR, but fasting guidelines may not be 100% correct.
            With assistance, I may eventually provide support for other US
            jurisdictions.</p>

            <p>
            This service is meant to be a tool for mobile developers and parish
            webmasters to use to provide this information to parishioners and
            other guests.
            <a href="https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-service">Source code</a>
            and a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/brianglass/orthocal-service/">docker
            image</a> for self-hosting are freely available.</p>

            <h2>Algorithm</h2>
            <p>The algorithm and data used in this service are based on the
            algorithm and data developed by Paul Kachur's 
            <a href="https://github.com/paulkachur/orthodox_calendar">orthodox_calendar</a> project. 
            As such, the commemoration data is incomplete.  The primary
            purpose of this service is to provide daily scripture readings for lay
            persons and not to be an authoritative guide to the feasts and fasts of the Church.</p>

            <h2>Scriptures</h2>
            <p>Because this is open-source and free, the service must use a
            translation of the Bible that is either public domain or has agreeable
            license terms. At this point I have chosen to stick with the King James
            Version. While not ideal, many clergy consider this to be one of the
            best options for Orthodox. Because the rubrics use Septuagint
            versification, a handful of the Old Testament readings may be incorrect.</p>

            <h2>Bugs</h2>
            <p>Please report bugs using the <a href="https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-service/issues">Github issue tracker</a>.</p>
